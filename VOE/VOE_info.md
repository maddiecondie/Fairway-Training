# VOE (Verification of Employment) Notes

Two kinds: Prior-To-Closing (PTC VVOE) and Prior-To-Funding (PTF VVOE)
Needs to be done in the morning when other businesses with other timezones are open.

## PTC VOE
+ PTC within week before closing

## PTF VOE
+ Different for purchases and refinances.
+ Must be the day before the funding date.
+ For purchases, funding date is usually closing date. Get them the business day before funding.
+ Refinances have a 3-day recission period. 
+ After a refi signing, set a calender date 3 days after to do it.
+ Two types of refinances don't have 3-day recission: refi investment properties and maybe second home refis.

3. IF not, go to 1003 page 1, get correct employment start date info
4. Search for that company on google
5. Call them, if hospital, request transfer to HR
