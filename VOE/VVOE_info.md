# VOE (Verification of Employment) Notes

Two kinds: Prior-To-Closing (PTC VVOE) and Prior-To-Funding (PTF VVOE)
Needs to be done in the morning when other businesses with other timezones are open.

## PTC VOE
+ PTC within week before closing

## PTF VOE
+ Different for purchases and refinances.
+ Must be the day before the funding date.
+ For purchases, funding date is usually closing date. Get them the business day before funding.
+ Refinances have a 3-day recission period. 
+ After a refi signing, set a calender date 3 days after to do it.
+ Two types of refinances don't have 3-day recission: refi investment properties and maybe second home refis.

# Order of Steps for Non-Self-Employed:
### Planning VVOE Dates
1. Go to Encompass Pipeline view and find VOE **TODO add more detail**
1. Open the file of a specific borrower
1. `Forms` tab > `Show All` and `Show in Alpha Order` checkboxes checked > `Origination Summary`
1. `Important Dates` section > Check `Estimated Funding` and `Estimated Closing` dates are
    + If they are the same day, it is generally a purchase, not a refi.
    + If funding is before closing date (funding won't be before closing in reality), the closing date has been moved, so the funding date for refis will generally be 3 days after the closing date. 
1. Verify type of loan (refinance vs. purchase)
    + Borrower Summary - Origination > Purpose of Loan > Check refi or not and type of refi
    
### Executing VVOEs
1. Open eFolder > Check VOE folder > Open the VOE if it exists
    + Shows us direct employer contact info, occassional start date, and position
    + If it doesn't exist, that's ok, just continue and get info from other steps
1. Services > Order Verifications > Work Number > `Report on Borrower` and `Employment Only` and `Current Employers`
	+ Will have good-as-of date
	+ If Workday verifies them, no need for Verbal.
    + If it pulls info up, make sure the `Current As Of` date is:
        + For PTC: at most 7 days before closing date for PTC
        + For PTF: on the previous business day before funding for PTF
1. In VOE bucket, sometimes direct employer info is in there, so you can contact someone
