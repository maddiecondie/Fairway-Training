# VOE (Verification of Employment) Notes

Two kinds: Prior-To-Closing (PTC VVOE) and Prior-To-Funding (PTF VVOE)
Needs to be done in the morning when other businesses with other timezones are open.

## PTC VOE
+ PTC within week before closing

## PTF VOE
+ Different for purchases and refinances.
+ Must be the day before the funding date.
+ For purchases, funding date is usually closing date. Get them the business day before funding.
+ Refinances have a 3-day recission period. 
+ After a refi signing, set a calender date 3 days after to do it.
+ Two types of refinances don't have 3-day recission: refi investment properties and maybe second home refis.

# Self-Employed VOEs 
+ This is for Prior to Closing (PTC)
  + Open blank `Verbal VOE for Self-Employment`
  + Fill out `Date`, `Closing Date`, `Borrower`, and `Business Name`
  + Google `Utah Business entity search` or other state > Search business name
  + Upload screenprint of their business entity to `Verbal Prior to Wire`
  + Check the `Printout of valid business registration` box in Self-Employment blank sheet
  + Verify they are active through Google:
  	+ Google business name and look for hours
  	+ Make sure they are able to work from home in their job
  	+ For COVID: Check if they currently have a stay-at-home order
  	+ Screenclip this business info card from Google and put it in the `Verbal Prior to Wire`
    + Check `Printout of listing for business on internet` in VOE form
    + Save and put it in `Verbal Prior to Wire` eFolder bucket
+ For Prior to Funding (PTF):
  + Send this template:
	> Hey `Processor`!
	>
	>The primary/co- borrower on this file is self-employed. Per current COVID-19 guidelines they will need to sign the attached borrower affidavit no more than 24 hours prior to funding.
	>
	>Please let me know if you have any questions.
  + Also, attach the blank `Borrower's Acknowledge of Employment` affadavit document.


# Order of Steps for Non-Self-Employed:
### Planning VVOE Dates
#### OLD Process
  1. Go to Encompass Pipeline view and find VOE **TODO add more detail**
  2. Open the file of a specific borrower
  3. `Forms` tab > `Show All` and `Show in Alpha Order` checkboxes checked > `Origination Summary`
  4. `Important Dates` section > Check `Estimated Funding` and `Estimated Closing` dates are
      + If they are the same day, it is generally a purchase, not a refi.
      + If funding is before closing date (funding won't be before closing in reality), the closing date has been moved, so the funding date for refis will generally be 3 days after the closing date. 
  5. Verify type of loan (refinance vs. purchase)
      + Borrower Summary - Origination > Purpose of Loan > Check refi or not and type of refi
#### NEW PROCESS
1. Run VOE-TODO report and format it. Upload it to Microsoft Teams Voes Team
    
### Executing VVOEs
1. Open eFolder > Check VOE folder > Open the VOE if it exists
    + Shows us direct employer contact info, occassional start date, and position
    + If it doesn't exist, that's ok, just continue and get info from other steps
1. Services > Order Verifications > Work Number > `Report on Borrower` and `Employment Only` and `Current Employers`
	+ Will have good-as-of date
	+ If Workday verifies them, no need for Verbal.
    + If it pulls info up, make sure the `Current As Of` date is:
        + For PTC: at most 7 days before closing date for PTC
        + For PTF: on the previous business day before funding for PTF
1. In VOE bucket, sometimes direct employer info is in there, so you can contact someone
1. Go to `1003 Page 1`, get correct employment start date info
1. Search for that company on google
1. Call them, if hospital, request transfer to HR
1. Fill Out the VOE Form on local machine
