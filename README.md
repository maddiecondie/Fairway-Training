## Understanding the Process:
- PLP stands for "Perfect Loan Process". This is a big philosophy/motto the entire Branch strives to live by each and every day while working on files. Jeana and Josh created the "Perfect Loan Process" and what that looks like for each position. Your role is to help create a cheerful and joyous experience for clients amidst the common stresses of buying a new home.
- There are 3-4 gifts that our Branch sends out to our clients on Purchase Loans ONLY
    - A few exceptions: You can send out PLP gifts on files that aren't purchaes files with special requests from LOs (most likely a file that went sour or the clients are close family friends of the LO etc.)
    - Katrinka Condie has been approved by Josh Mettle for PLP gifts on any of her REFI files. She'll send you a list every once in awhile with client names that need to be sent certain gifts (usually only cutting boards- she'll clarify where to send these as well). 
- These PLP gifts are sent at specific milestones in each loan. 
    - 1st gift: Stress relief tea/spray is sent when the loan reaches the ` submitted to processing ` milestone.
    - 2nd gift: Cookies are sent once the loan has reached the ` initial loan approval ` milestone.
        - (side gift): The Berenstein Bears picture book is sent at the same time cookies are ordered to clients with 1 or more dependents ages 12 and under.
    - 3rd gift: Custom bamboo cutting board is sent once the loan has ` funded ` 
- LOs choose to be apart of the PLP gift campaigns or not. If you notice you aren't sending any gifts for a certain LO, chances are they chose to opt out of sending the PLP gifts. 
    - LOs take a compensation ("comp") cut to send PLP gifts. This is how everything is funded.
- All of the emails you receive directing you to order a specific PLP gift are automated and from Bntouch. Once a file reaches or passes one of the milestones above, BnTouch automatically sends you emails. 
    - If you ever have any problems with the emails, reach out to Colin Jenson and specify which "campaign" (ex; tea campaign) needs to be checked out and corrected. He manages the automated emails inside BnTouch for our Branch.

## Email Organization:
### Important Emails:
- `"Please order"` means it is either cutting board or cookie/book, no need to even open the email. Flag it.
- `"Please send"` means tea/spray. Flag it.
- `"New Customer Registration" from Josh Mettle` is HomeScout email
- Specific custom tasks (usually from Kim Cowdell, Jeana, Josh, Colin)

### Organization Tips:
- Add subfolders to Inbox, namely:
    - "Jeana" : Assistant Work, Tasks, Custom Reports
    - "Joe Kieszekj" : Cookie Contact
    - "New Applications" : Routine Reports
    - "PLP" : These emails require action and todo will go here as `flagged` and completed will be `checked` 
        - "Cookies"
        - "Cuting Boards"
        - "HomeScout"
        - "Tea/Spray"
    - "PLP Finances" : These emails usually don't require action, just for tracking. They can be put there immediately after being recieved. These emails could be filtered
        - "Cookie Invoices" : Receipts sent from Joe, forward with message like "Here's this month's cookie invoice :)" to Kim Cowdell to file away (**AUTOMATABLE: Can be put in folder and forwarded to Kim, but must be read to RESPOND to Joe**)
        - "Cookie Tracking" : Shipping information sent from Joe
        - "Cutting Board Tracking" : Sent from Qualtry, (**AUTOMATABLE: Can be put in folder without reading**)
        - "Spray Tracking" : Bath & Body Works shipping and order confirmations
        - "Tea Supply Tracking" : Tracking info and order confirmation from Amazon & ULine
    - Reports : Holds custom report request threads 
- As tasks are finished, you can move the `checked` emails to their corresponding folders
- This all helps for validating your work and tracking orders
